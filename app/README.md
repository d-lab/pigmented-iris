# Pigmented Iris Crowdsourcing Project

Welcome to the Pigmented Iris Crowdsourcing repository! This project aims to leverage the power of crowd workers to identify and annotate pigmented points within iris images. The repository is built upon the Mephisto platform, which allows for efficient management and execution of crowdsourcing tasks. This README will guide you through setting up and deploying the project using GitHub Actions.

## Introduction

The human iris is a complex structure that can exhibit various patterns and pigmented points. This project aims to crowdsource the identification and annotation of pigmented points within iris images. Crowd workers will be presented with iris images and will be asked to mark the points they identify as pigmented. The aggregated results will contribute to a dataset for further analysis and research.

The project is built upon the Mephisto platform, which streamlines the process of managing, launching, and collecting data from crowdsourcing tasks.

## Running the Crowdsourcing Task

Follow the instruction in /app/README.md to run the crowdsourcing task.
